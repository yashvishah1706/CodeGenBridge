# CodeGenBridge
CodeGenBridge is a research-grade framework that compares API-based and custom-trained code generation models using both qualitative and quantitative metrics. It fine-tunes a 350M-parameter transformer using LoRA on 5,000+ Python scripts from CodeParrot and evaluates its performance against GitHub Copilot (OpenAI Codex API).
